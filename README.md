# training-game-prototype

## TODO
- Learning from Picking up Cherries to follow trainer
  - Thinking have a "memory" object that belongs to the model and gets updated by actions...so we're being declarative
    alternatively, could have analysis of past actions and have emergent behavior, but that's too complex for this 
    prototype
- More natural penguin behavior
- Grass background
- Player teach commands
- Pathfinding
